\section*{Artemia}
\textit{\textbf{Captain's Log:} We have just completed our mission to deliver supplies to the colony and terraforming operation on Artemia. Evelyn Garza, the colony administrator, was eager to receive the supplies that we brought and immediately set her team to unloading and distributing them.}

\textit{During the ensuing commotion, a colonist named Wyatt Adams discretely contacted a member of our security team. He claims that he has found something at his homestead that we need to see. I have sent an away team to investigate.}

\subsection*{Arrival}
\textbf{Wyatt Adams} leads you to the mouth of a small cave near his homestead. After a short crawl through a cramped tunnel, the cave opens into \textbf{The Vault}. Lights automatically flicker to life and you see that this room is filled with stasis chambers and the walls are lined with computer terminals.

Machinery starts to hum all around you as more systems come online. Suddenly, a loud rumbling fills the air and the ground shakes violently. It looks like there's been a landslide! The tunnel that you used to access The Vault has collapsed.

\subsubsection*{Buried Alive}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Will you try to use the computer terminals to call for help?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{The Vault}. If you prevail, you get a 1d6 advantage die on all subsequent challenges vs \textbf{The Vault}.
	\item \textit{Or will you try to find another way out of The Vault?} \textbf{Strategy \& Tactics} vs. \textbf{Caves (2d8)}. This is a \textit{Grueling} challenge \textendash{} the caves are a maze of labyrinthine tunnels.  
\end{itemize}

You will not have access to resources from the colony or the Endeavour until you escape from The Vault.

\subsection*{Trials}

\subsubsection*{Message in a Bottle}
Among the specimens in The Vault is a collection of artifacts that describe the language and technology used by the ancient Artemiidae. \textit{Can you decipher enough of their language to discover what happened to the Artemiidae?} \textbf{Science \& Medicine} vs. \textbf{The Vault}.% It appears that some artifacts are missing. \textit{Can you find the missing items?} \textbf{Strategy \& Tactics} vs. \textbf{Wyatt Adams}.

\subsubsection*{Terraforming}
The colonists are eager to distribute their new seed stock. \textbf{Evelyn Garza} suggests that the Endeavour's shuttles could be modified to help with the operation. \textit{Will you delay your departure so that you can help the colonists sow their seeds?}
\textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{Aerial Application (2d8)}.

\subsubsection*{Power Failure}
The power goes out in The Vault. It had been running on emergency batteries since the landslide. \textit{Can you find an alternate power source?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{The Vault}. If you fail, any specimens that are not reconstituted soon will be lost. \textit{Can you convince the colonists to help?} \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{Evelyn Garza}.



\subsection*{Crisis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Will you shut down the terraforming operation so that the reconstituted Artemiidae can survive on their home world?} \\ \textbf{Threats:} All non-native life on the planet's surface dies. Runaway climate change makes the planet uninhabitable. Wyatt Adams refuses to abandon his homestead.
	\item \textit{Or will you modify the Artemiidae to allow them to live as part of the planet's new ecosystem?} \textbf{Threats:} The genetic modifications fail and the Artemiidae cannot be revived. The colonists quietly eradicate any new ``invasive'' species. Evelyn Garza is infected and killed by a viral Artemiidae.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Places}
\begin{description}
	\item[The Vault:] A huge underground warehouse filled with specimens containing Artemiidae genetic information.
	\item[Terraforming Station:] A modern industrial complex that supports the many chemical and biological processes required to modify the environment of Artemia.
	\item[Wyatt's Homestead:] A small biodome, set far from the rest of the colony. The interior is filled with an eclectic mix of modern and primitive technology.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Mysteries}
\begin{description}
	\item[The Artemiidae died millions of years ago.] \phantom{a} \\ They preserved their genetic information in The Vault in the hopes that future alien explorers might be able to reconstitute them. \textit{What happened to the Artemiidea? Why were they unable to save themselves?}
	\item[The colonists have been terraforming Artemia.] \phantom{a} \\ When the colony was established, Artemia was lifeless. Now, Terran plants and animals can survive outside of the colony's biodomes. The Artemiidae cannot cope with the new environment. \textit{Why did the colonists come here? What do they know about the Artemiidae?}
