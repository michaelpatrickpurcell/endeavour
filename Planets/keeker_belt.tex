\section*{Keeker Belt}
\textit{\textbf{Captain's Log:} We have arrived at the the Keeker Belt, an asteroid field that is home to two different species: the Keeker Belters and the X'un. Recently, tension between the two has been mounting, fueled by a series of hijackings and ransom demands by a group of aggressive X'un pirates. We are here as peacekeepers and to prevent any further escalation of violence.}

\textit{Kazzark, the Keeker Belter ambassador to the X'un, has been tasked with contacting the pirates and negotiating a ceasefire agreement. We have agreed to deliver him and a convoy of supply ships to a remote settlement near where the pirates are rumored to have a base of operations.}

\subsection*{Arrival}

%Ship captains are reluctant to travel alone and many refuse to leave port without an armed escort.

As you pass through a particularly dense part of the asteroid field, four saucer-shaped pirate ships converge on the convoy and attack, disabling a large cargo hauler that had fallen behind due to mechanical trouble.  Its captain, fearing a core breach, orders all hands to abandon ship. 

After their initial pass, the \textbf{X'un Pirates} execute a series of elaborate evasive maneuvers before turning to attack again. Three ships attack the convoy, while the fourth attempts to capture escape pods as they are ejected from the cargo hauler.

\subsubsection*{Ambush}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Will you interfere with the pirates' hijacking attempt?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{X'un Pirates}. \\ If you suffer, the pirates capture several escape pods and hold their occupants for ransom.
	\item \textit{Or will you defend the convoy?} \textbf{Strategy \& Tactics} vs. \textbf{X'un Pirates}. This is a \textit{Grueling} challenge. If you suffer, the pirates destroy the Endeavour's weapons systems. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Trials}
%\subsubsection*{Traffic Control}
%The threat of pirate attacks complicate any travel within the Keeker Belt. Ship captains are reluctant to travel alone and many refuse to travel to remote parts of the belt without an armed escort. \textit{Can you devise a way to keep traffic flowing without exposing any civilian ships to unnecessary risk?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{Wartime Logistics (3d8)}.

\subsubsection*{Aftermath}
Escape pods from the damaged cargo hauler are strewn throughout the void around you. \textit{Can you recover the escape pods before the pirates return?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{Asteroid Field}. Among the survivors of the attack are small group of X'un who served aboard the cargo hauler as maintenance workers and stewards for the ship's officers.

\subsubsection*{Internment}
Kazzark fears that the pirates have infiltrated the convoy. He relieves all X'un crew members of duty and confines them to their quarters. \textit{Will you defend the X'un crew members from Kazzark's wrath?} \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{Kazzark}.

\subsubsection*{Signals Intelligence}
The X'un ships are in constant communication with one another. While it is easy to intercept these signals, any messages that you collect are heavily encrypted. \textit{Can you find a way to break the encryption?} \textbf{Science \& Medicine} vs. \textbf{Encrypted Messages (3d8)}. If you prevail, you get a 1d8 advantage die on all future challenges vs. \textbf{X'un Pirates}.

\subsection*{Crisis}

\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Will you recruit a posse of Keeker Belters and confront the pirates directly?} \textbf{Threats:} Your posse is killed in action. Kazzark is assassinated by a X'un internee. The Keeker Belters force the X'un out of the system.
%	\item \textit{Or will you wage a guerrilla campaign against the pirates on your own?} \textbf{Threats:} Hundreds of Keeker Belter and X'un civilians die as they are caught in the crossfire. The Endeavour is captured by the X'un Pirates. The X'un force the Keeker Belters out of the system. 
	\item \textit{Will you confront the X'un pirates directly?} \\ \textbf{Threats:} The Endeavour is captured by the X'un pirates. Kazzark is assassinated by a X'un internee. Hundreds of X'un civilians die as they are caught in the crossfire.
	\item \textit{Will you convince the X'un pirates to surrender peacefully?} \\ \textbf{Threats:} Kazzark is kidnapped by the X'un pirates and held for ransom. The Keeker Belters cut off all diplomatic ties with the X'un. Hundreds of Keeker Belters die when peace talks break down and hostilities resume.

\subsection*{Places}
\begin{description}
	\item[Keeker Belter Habitat:] A twisting maze of tunnels bored directly into the rock of an asteroid. Crowded, noisy, and filled with exotic technological marvels.
	\item[X'un Pirate Ship:] A ramshackle starship cobbled together from the parts of captured vessels. 
%	\item[Asteroid Field] Billions of constantly shifting asteroids distributed in a loose ring around a central star. 
\end{description}

\subsection*{Mysteries}
\begin{description}
	\item[Most Keeker Belters look down on the X'un.] \phantom{a} \\ Both species are insectile humanoids. The Keeker Belters are very social but retain a strong sense of individual identity. The X'un are are eusocial creatures and each X'un colony effectively functions as a single organism. \textit{How do the X'un feel about the Keeker Belters? Why do the Keeker Belters feel such disdain for the X'un? }
	\item[The X'un pirates think of themselves as soldiers.] \phantom{a} \\ The X'un are treated as second-class citizens by the Keeker Belters. The X'un pirates took up arms in response to their depressed economic and political circumstances. \textit{What are the pirates trying to accomplish? Why won't the Keeker Belters help them to do so?}
