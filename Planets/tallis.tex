\section*{Tallis}
\textit{\textbf{Captain's Log:} We are in orbit around Tallis, where we have been invited to represent the ICF as honored guests at the upcoming Royal Tallis Military Tattoo.}

\textit{Also representing the ICF at the Tattoo are the ICF Flight Demonstration Squadron. They have been training with their Tallist counterparts in preparation for a joint performance, which they will use to showcase a novel stealth technology.}


\subsection*{Arrival}
The Royal Tallis Military Tattoo is held at Royal Stadium. The sun is shining and the crowd are in high spirits.%in a large open-air stadium. Tens of thousands  of spectators attend the event.

The demonstration team's performance is an impressive display of the pilots' skill. They use cloaking devices to create a dazzling display as their ships appear and disappear while performing high-speed maneuvers over the stadium.

Then, an explosion sounds and four of the demonstration team's ships spiral out of control. One ship crashes into the stadium, leaving hundreds people of dead or injured.

\subsubsection*{Disaster Response}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Will you help the Tallists treat the wounded spectators?} \\ \textbf{Science \& Medicine} vs. \textbf{Emergency Medicine (3d8)}. \\ Mark \textit{Experience} if you face this challenge \textendash{} you will not soon forget what you see in the ruins of the stadium.
	\item \textit{Or will you lead the effort to recover the pilots/ships?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs \textbf{Rescue Effort (3d8)}.  \\ This is a \textit{Fraught} challenge \textendash{} Ignoring the plight of the spectators will not endear you to your hosts.
\end{itemize}

The sole surviving member of the joint demonstration team is \textbf{Ensign Sparke}. His ship was undamaged in the accident.

\newpage

\subsection*{Trials}

\subsubsection*{Preliminary Hearing}
\textbf{Gouyen, the Tallist Magistrate} convenes a hearing to determine the cause of the accident. She rules that Ensign Sparke should be detained and his ship impounded pending the outcome of a more thorough investigation. \textit{Can you convince her to release Ensign Sparke into your custody?} \textbf{Strategy \& Tactics} vs. \textbf{Gouyen}.

\subsubsection*{Missing Evidence}
The demonstration team's ships were cloaked intermittently throughout the show. As such, the Tallists have been unable to completely reconstruct the events immediately prior to the accident. \textit{Can you find a way to reconstruct what happened?} \textbf{Science \& Medicine} vs. \textbf{Cloaking Technology (2d10)}. 

%\subsubsection*{A Confession}
%Ensign Sparke privately confesses that he was unwell before the show, but that Lieutenant Phillips ordered him to fly anyway. He fears that he lost consciousness during a high-g maneuver shortly before the accident occurred. \textit{Can you surreptitiously access his flight recorder to determine whether he caused the accident?} \textbf{Strategy \& Tactics} vs. \textbf{Gouyen}.

\subsubsection*{Survivor Guilt}
Ensign Sparke's behavior in the aftermath of the accident is concerning. He clearly blames himself for what happened. \textit{Can you get Ensign Sparke to talk to you about how he feels?} \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{Ensign Sparke}. \\ If you prevail, he confesses that he was unwell before the show, but that Lieutenant Phillips ordered him to fly anyway.% He cannot recall what happened immediately before% the accident occurred.

\subsection*{Crisis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Will you, on behalf of the ICF, assume responsibility for the accident?} \textbf{Threats:} Gouyen finds Ensign Sparke guilty of negligent homicide. The Tallists withdraw from all future joint military exercises. ICF Command disbands the Flight Demonstration Squadron.
	\item \textit{Or will you try hold the Tallist pilots responsible?} \\ \textbf{Threats:} Ensign Sparke resigns his commission and leaves the ICF. The Tallist military withholds benefits from the families of the Tallist pilots.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Mysteries}
\begin{description}
	\item[Ensign Sparke indirectly caused the accident.] \phantom{a} \\ %Lieutenant Phillips ordered Ensign Sparke to fly despite his having reported that he was unwell before the show.
	 Ensign Sparke lost consciousness during a high-g maneuver and his ship drifted out of formation.  The Tallist flight commander swerved to avoid a collision, but in so doing she lost control of her ship. \textit{Why were they performing such a dangerous program? Why didn't any automated safeguards prevent this tragedy?}
