\section*{Juventas}
\textit{\textbf{Captain's Log:} Whilst returning from deep space, our engineers have identified rare, systemic damage to the Endeavourâ€™s energy calibration matrix. ICF Command have identified Juventas \textemdash{} a moonlet orbiting Edda II \textemdash{} as a source of expertise and equipment to rectify this problem.}

\textit{ Juventas, however, is outside of Interstellar Confederation space and is well-known for its anarchic community of engineers, poets, makers, writers, and tinkers. As official representatives of the ICF, we are unlikely to be welcome. Nevertheless, we must find someone willing to help us here.}

\subsection*{Arrival}
%You dock with the hollowed-out moonlet which is ablaze in clashing neon lighting and densely interconnected habitation modules. Shortly after you arrive, the power drops out temporarily before a secondary backup brings most systems back online. The Endeavour desperately needs repairs.

The Endeavour docks with the hollowed-out moonlet which is ablaze in clashing neon lighting and densely interconnected habitation modules. After you complete docking, the power drops temporarily before a secondary backup returns most systems online. The Endeavour desperately needs repairs.

As you disembark, two hovering robots approach and demand to know who you are and why you are here. They accept your answers and disappear into a tunnel nearby. The locals take little notice of you and continue on with their own business in what feels like an endless marketplace and artists' commune.

\subsubsection*{At Loose Ends}
\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{Will you try to convince the locals to help you find the assistance you need?} \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{The Commune}.
	\item \textit{Will you try to convince the locals to help you find someone who can help you repair the energy calibration matrix?} \\ \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{The Commune (2d8)}.
	\item \textit{Or will you try to navigate the marketplace on your own?} \textbf{Operations \& Engineering} vs. \textbf{Marketplace (2d8)}.
\end{itemize}
The atmosphere here is quite tense and you see several fights break out while you explore the labyrinthine space.

\subsection*{Trials}
%\subsubsection*{Too Many Troys}
%At Matrix Lacers, a young technician named Lacer Troy is threatening to kill his coworkers with a grenade. He claims that they are clones and that his real coworkers are missing. \textit{Can you convince Lacer Troy to surrender peacefully and release his hostages safely?} \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{Lacer Troy}. This is a \textit{Dangerous} and \textit{Fraught} challenge.

\subsubsection*{Too Many Lacers}
\textbf{Lacer Troy} stands outside of Matrix Lacers arguing with her partner Lacer Hamish and someone who appears to be her twin. Brandishing a pistol, Troy demands to know where they've taken the ``real'' Hamish. \textit{Can you convince Troy to put away her weapon and explain why she is so agitated?} \textbf{Leadership \& Negotiation} vs. \textbf{Lacer Troy}.

\subsubsection*{Dividing Line}
It seems that someone is cloning people, perhaps doing so without their knowledge or consent. Nobody seems to be able to distinguish between clones and the people from which they were copied. \textit{Can you find a way to determine if a person is a clone or an original?} \textbf{Science \& Medicine} vs. \textbf{Piker Savat}.

\subsubsection*{Infiltrators}
Security reports that two ICF cadets are attempting to board the shuttle back to the Endeavour, escorted by new floating robots. Those cadets reported back two hours ago. \textit{Can you convince the would-be infiltrators to tell you who sent them?} \textbf{Strategy \& Tactics} vs. \textbf{Cadets (2d8)}. If you prevail, gain a 1d10 Advantage die in challenges to locate Savat's Factory. 

\subsection*{Crisis}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Will you try to get back to the Endeavour before clones report for duty in your stead?} \textbf{Threats:} Troy is murdered by her clone. Piker Savat shares his technology to all of Juventas. Riots break out across Juventas as clones and originals argue over whom is entitled to what resources.
	\item \textit{Or will you try to track down Piker Savat in his lair?} \textbf{Threats:} Clones infiltrate the Endeavour. Piker Savat uses his clones as hostages and human shields. Hamish is killed while trying to escape from Savat's Factory.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Characters}
\begin{description}
	\item[Piker Savat (d10):] Innovative (d10), Cunning (d8), Arrogant (d8), Charming (d8), Amoral (d6 \textit{Sensitive}).
%	\item[Zonos (d8):] Head Lacer (d8), Clever (d8), Greedy (d8).%, Missing Hand (d6).
	\item[Lacer Troy (d8):] Lacer (d8), Paranoid (d6), Loyal (d6).
	\item[Clone (d?):] \textbf{\textsc{Doppelg\"anger}} (Clones have the same skills and memories as the person from which they were copied).\\ \textbf{\textsc{Unsettling}} (Challenges vs. one's own clone are \textit{Fraught}).
\end{description}

\subsection*{Places}
\begin{description}
	\item[Edda II:] A dangerous planet whipped by strong winds and planet-wide blue copper dust storms.
%	\item[Juventas:] A hollowed-out moonlet of Edda II.
	\item[Matrix Lacers:] A small but pioneering workshop in energy matrix engineering. One of the few places outside the ICF and private labs to research this technology.
	\item[Savat's Factory:] A hidden high-tech laboratory where Piker Savat has revolutionized rapid cloning technology.
	The workshop features a sign that says ``2 is 1; 1 is none.''

\subsection*{Mysteries}
\begin{description}
	\item[Juventas is home to many skilled artisans.] \phantom{} \\ Because there is no government on Juventas, it is a haven for those whose interests might be considered exotic or illegal elsewhere.  \textit{ How do they survive out here? What attracted the first denizens of Juventas to the moonlet?}
%	\item[Piker Savat's clones are imperfect.] \phantom{} \\ Outwardly, the clones are identical to the person from which they were copied. Inwardly, they inevitably differ in subtle ways. \textit{What are the potential applications of this technology? How can you tell if a person is a clone? }
	\item[Piker Savat is cloning people without permission.] \phantom{} \\
	Piker Savat's clones are imperfect. Outwardly, the clones are identical to the person from which they were copied. Inwardly, however, they inevitably differ in subtle ways. \textit{What are the potential applications of this technology? How can you tell if a person is a clone?}
