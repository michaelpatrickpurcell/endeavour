\section*{Introduction} \label{section:introduction}
Prophecy is a GM-less roleplaying game for three to six people that can be played in under three hours.
During the game, the players receive a prophecy that describes an impending catastrophe for some fictional world and tell a story about characters whose lives will be affected by that catastrophe. 

The players first decide the basic outline of the story, describing events that are fated to occur. 
 They then fill in the details of the story, describing how the characters try to shape their destiny.

Throughout these rules, a variety of common words are used as technical terms to describe how the game is played.
These terms will be \emph{italicised} when they are first introduced.
References to sections of the rules will be written in the same font as the \hyperref[section:introduction]{\cinzel \small Section Headings}.

\subsection*{Materials} \label{subsection:materials}
To play the game the players will need a few materials that they will use to take notes and determine outcomes.
They will need:
\begin{description}
	\item[Index Cards:] Approximately fifty index cards should be placed within easy reach of all players. 
	\item[Sticky Notes:] Approximately one hundred sticky notes should be placed within easy reach of all players.
	\item[Butcher Paper:] One large sheet of butcher paper should be placed in the middle of the play area.  A whiteboard can be used instead if desired. This is the \emph{story board}.
	\item[Markers:] Each player should have a marker% to write on the index cards, sticky notes, and story board.
%	\item[Dice:] Approximately twelve six-sided dice should be placed within easy reach of all players. 
\end{description}

%\section*{Modules} \label{section:modules}
%The first thing that the players do is \hyperref[subsection:receive-a-prophecy]{\cinzel \small Receive a Prophecy}.  \\
%This is the inciting incident for everything that happens in the story.
%%It's important!
%By describing the catastrophe, the players establish the foundation on which the rest the game will be built.
%
%A \emph{module} is a pre-written prophecy designed to help the players get started.
%Each module describes a catastrophe as it might be presented to characters who are hearing the prophecy for the first time.  The players should read the module aloud and populate the world that it implies with objects and aspects.

%\subsection*{The Tachyonic Antitelephone} \label{subsection:the-tachyonic-antitelephone}
%I am, well \ldots I'm you.  That is, I was. Or, you will be.  Or, something like that. Anyway, I'm afraid that I've got some bad news. Really bad. You see, it turns out that the work that you did for DARPA last year was used to create something that we used to think impossible.
%They built a time machine. 
%
%Fortunately, it's pretty limited.  It can only send messages back in time, and then only to times after they turned it on.  That's why I'm talking to you now instead of earlier when it might have done some good.
%
%Unfortunately, it turns out that messing around with time is a bad idea.
%Really bad. It didn't take long before strange things started to happen.
%Then the Time Eaters came.
%
%It's too late for us. 
%Maybe, though, its not too late for you.
%If nothing else, you might be able to pass this message along in turn when you get here. 
%Eventually, one of us is sure to figure a way out of this mess.
%Right?

%\subsection*{Project Spaceguard} \label{subsection:project-spaceguard}
%My fellow Americans, it is with a heavy heart that I come to you tonight. 
%As you are doubtless aware, last year the initial survey conducted as a part of Project Spaceguard discovered a large Near Earth Object that was projected to collide with the Earth later this month.
%Ever since, the primary focus of this administration has been to prevent that from occurring. Earlier this evening, the director of Project Spaceguard informed me that we have failed.
%
%Now, we must shift our focus from preventing a collision to surviving its aftermath.
%Effective immediately, I am declaring a nationwide state of emergency. 
%National Guard units will be activated and deployed in support of local law enforcement. 
%
%Going forward, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be leading our response.
%I'll turn the microphone over to the director of that agency now and he can provide details about what you can expect.
%Goodnight and Godspeed.

%\subsection*{She's Having a Baby} \label{subsection:shes-having-a-baby}
%Congratulations! It looks like you're at about eight weeks now.
%Everything looks great, both mum and bub are doing fine. 
%So, we'll plan on seeing you again in about four weeks.
%
%While you're here I should tell you about the course that the hospital offers for new parents.
%It's a great way to learn about what to expect and a chance talk to other new parents about the whole experience. 
%The teachers are all former maternity ward nurses, and they really do a great job.
%
%I know that this can be overwhelming.
%If you have any concerns, please give us a call at any time.

%You know what this means don't you?
%That crackpot down in R\&D was right. 
%Every Faraday Byron that we've sold in the past two years is a ticking time bomb.
%The first ones off the assembly line are going to start failing soon.
%After that, every week will be worse than the one before.
%
%We're not going to be able to keep this quiet for long.
%Soon, even your pet politicians are going to have to do something.
%What then?
%Eventually they're going to figure out that we knew this might happen.
%I bet it takes them less than a month.
%
%Someone is going down for this, and it's not going to be me.
%I'm leaving!
%Maybe I'll go somewhere warm. 
%Somewhere with white-sand beaches, palm trees,  and no extradition treaty.
